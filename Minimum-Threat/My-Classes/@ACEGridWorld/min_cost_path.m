PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
-------------------
Path optimization in the class definition of grid world. "Discovers"
neighbours and assigns vertex numbers as they are discovered.

knownIDs	= Inf(nVertices, 1);									
% This is the list of known vertex IDs; the row number in this list is the
% vertex number for that ID 

% The assumption here is that the function that discovers neighbouring
% vertices also provides a **unique** identifier to each vertex. The main
% difference from a typical Dijkstra implementation is that the vertex ID
% (which can be large) need not match this algorithm's internal indexing,
% which is helpful when the #vertices searched << total number of vertices.
